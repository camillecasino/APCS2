best first search
   when you add each node to the frontier, first assign a priority and then add    to the frontier which is a priority queue (ordered list)
Maze heuristics:
1. distance formula (Euclidean)
2. Manhattan (taxi cab) distance
   vertical and horizontal components

A* search
priority of Node n = cost to get to node N + estimated distance to goal
