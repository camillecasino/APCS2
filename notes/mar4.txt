the merge sort has log(base2)(n)
however, we always keep copying the elements whenver we split them
The array = n
The sum of each level's merge is also n
Big O notation - a function f(n) is said to be O(g(n)) or "Big O g of n" if there exists some constant such that k*g(n) > f(n)
over the long term
